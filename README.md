# eMobilis - Third Challenge/ Assignment(Function Challenge)

This is a solution to my third eMobilis Expolorer class Assignment
We were to learning on functions and were to create a function that takes multiple variables to achieve something 
NOTE : This still has my second challenge files and its README file can be found in the `master` or  `maaszaxxs` branches
