# eMobilis - Second Challenge/ Assignment(PHP Looping)

This is a solution to my second eMobilis Expolorer class Assignment
We were to learning on loops using while, do .. while, `switch`, for, and foreach loop types

## Overview

- while and do ... while loops
- switch statement
- for and foreach loops

## My process

While and do ... while looping:
 -Here did an while loop for a certain number x with an increment of x+=y upto a certain value z 

Switch statement:
 - Where the fun begun created an array `mycars` that took strings of certain types of cars e.g limo, F1 
 - For all cases echoed a message for every type of car from a variable `mycar` that randomly selected a car from the array created 
 
For and foreach looping:
 - For the `for loop did an echo of numbers from num i = 10 with a single value decrement i-- upto the value i=0

 - For the `foreach` loop did an echo of all the `types of cars` in the `mycars` array 

### Built with

- PHP
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I learned about collaboration in github
- I collaborated with `kibiwot kosgei` to add more types of cars the merged the branch he created onto my branch

- The process was as follows:-
  - I first sent him an invite to collaborate from the `settings` in my repository
  - I invited him and granted him write access to the repo

    - First he initialized git to clone the repo locally where he wanted the files e.g (/c/xaamp/htdocs/phplearn) with `git init`.
    - He then cloned the repository to his local machine `git clone https://github.com/eMobilis-Explorer/loops.git` 
    - Next he did the changes to the `loops.php` file by adding the new types of cars to it
    - Thereafter he created a new branch to commit the changes to it (NOTE MAKING CHANGES DIRECTLY TO THE MASTER BRANCH WONT ALLOW FOR MERGING THE REPOS)
    - Creating new branch `git checkout -b kibi` (kibi is the branch name - can be anything )
    - After this is now the normal process `git add loops.php` then `git commit -m "Commit Message"` and finally `git push origin kibi` -- (note pushing is to your branch not to the master branch)
    - Done the changes are now remotely on github
 
  - The `merging part` now falls on the owner of the repository me in this case
    - First I create a new `pull request` this is ddone on the repository page 
    - Select the comparison wth base being the `master` branch and `kibi` the comparison branch
    - Create a pull request and view the changes the accept the merge if the changes are acceptable which it was `kudos kibi üëèüèæ`

  - If you're still here reading note that you have pull the new merged repo to your local machine before making changes to commit later. (the master branch owner not the collaborator because they have all the latest changes locally).
    - This is done by `git pull origin master` ; then you can now see the changes appear locally before making any more edits 


### Continued development


 - I would like to have a huge collaboration with more than six people all doing a bit of a huge website
